		<p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Studying AI allows us to understand not only more about machines but also the intelligence itself. With the help of the artificial neural network, the AI algorithm has achieved impressive results in many applications, even though some are better than humans. However, even the best AI systems remain far below the level of humans on many of the core abilities associated with intelligence. While they excel in narrow domains, they largely lack the commonsense and intuitive knowledge that underlies intelligent behavior, as well as the ability to form abstract concepts and transfer knowledge fluidly between situations.<p>
		<p>	My current research interest focuses on the broad topic of how to draw inspiration from various intelligence, such as the brain, ant colony, economic market, etc., and use it to develop more powerful algorithms for solving complex problems. It requires a broader and deeper understanding of the sources of intelligence in natural systems. Specifically, my current project is twofold. On the one hand, I am working on brain network analysis and animal behavior modeling in order to provide me with some insights into biological networks. On the other hand, I am diving into the AI applications, such as computer vision, to see how biological insights can be integrated into the previous advanced method to boost the performance of AI systems. <p>
